The `gradle-wrapper.properties` file needs to be updated to use the appropriate Gradle version.  Additionally, the `build.gradle` files in the `android` directory may require adjustments to specify the correct AGP version.  Refer to the Expo documentation and release notes for the most up-to-date Gradle and AGP version compatibility information.  In some cases, it may be necessary to clean the project build files to resolve any cached conflicts.
